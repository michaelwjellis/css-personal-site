        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I have spent more than half a decade working in sales and fintech where I have learned a great wealth of knowledge. I wanted to learn full stack web development because the tech side of my work always interested me more than my actual job
          responsibilities. I have learned and can now apply my critical thinking skills with full stack to build, debug, and design websites.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>My father taught me to cook from a young age, using basic ingredients, and cooking ‘from scratch’. We gathered food from the markets, our backyard garden, and from local producers, and cooked mostly with what was in season and locally
          grown. Over the years I have refined my style of cooking as well as the ingredients I use each season. I am thankful for all my father taught me in my early years in order to create and build upon my style.</p>
